### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am currently working on an Aerial Vehicle System with Vision that aids in construction progress monitoring and works together with mobile robots on the ground. I get to dabble with YoloV5, Pytorch, OpenCV, programming a Tello drone and hope to update this space once that project is completed!
